## Read in data

```{r}
library(readr)
library(sf)
library(here)
library(tidyr)
Composite_indices <- read.csv(here("homework4_data","HDR23-24_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv"))
World_Countries <- st_read(here("homework4_data","World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson" ))

names(Composite_indices)
names(World_Countries)

```

## Join data
caculate difference in inequality between 2010 and 2019
Make a join ID colum
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(countrycode)
gender_inequality <- Composite_indices %>%
  select(iso3, contains("gii"))

gender_inequality2 <- gender_inequality %>%
   mutate(gii_2019_2010 = gii_2019 - gii_2010)

World_Countries2 <- World_Countries %>%
  mutate(ISO3 = countrycode(ISO,"iso2c","iso3c"))

world_gender_inequality <- World_Countries2 %>%
  left_join(gender_inequality2, by = c("ISO3" = "iso3"))


```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
