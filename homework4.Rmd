## Read in data
```{r}
library(readr)
library(sf)
library(here)
library(tidyr)
Composite_indices <- read.csv(here("homework4_data","HDR23-24_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv"))
World_Countries <- st_read(here("homework4_data","World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson" ))

names(Composite_indices)
names(World_Countries)

```

## Process and join data
Caculate difference in inequality between 2010 and 2019
Transfer iso2c to iso3c by using countrycode package
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(countrycode)
gender_inequality <- Composite_indices %>%
  select(iso3, contains("gii"))

gender_inequality2 <- gender_inequality %>%
   mutate(gii_2019_2010 = gii_2019 - gii_2010)

World_Countries2 <- World_Countries %>%
  mutate(ISO3 = countrycode(ISO,"iso2c","iso3c"))

world_gender_inequality <- World_Countries2 %>%
  left_join(gender_inequality2, by = c("ISO3" = "iso3"))


```

## Plotting a map 
To Demonstrate the difference in the gender inequality index between 2010 and 2019

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(world_gender_inequality) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = gii_2019_2010), 
          color = "darkgray", 
          size = 0.1) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2(
    low = "#4575B4", 
    mid = "#FFFFFF", 
    high = "#D73027", 
    midpoint = 0, 
    na.value = "grey80", 
    name = "GII Difference") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Gender Inequality Index Difference (2010-2019)") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
